# AI-Powered Pre-Development Planning Workflow: From Idea to Implementation-Ready Specification

*Transform vague product ideas or existing product requirements document (PRD) into detailed, AI-executable requirements*

I have created PRD after PRD to create MVP after MVP. One consistent pattern I've found is that AI tools are hit and miss if the requirements are not clear. I knew early that I needed to be more specific and provide as much content needed to get some coding done. And that works in a vacuum. But as my project gets bigger and the more different AI agents touch it, I'm left with a huge mess.
I've heard from a lot of sources that the more time spent in the planning phase, the easier time you'll have in the development phase. I've found this to be true. But it wasn't deep enough. 

I set out to fully flesh out every requirement for a project prior to starting development. The usual tech stack, the overall goal and features required of course. But then to take the features list and break it down until I can't anymore. 

Breakdown Hierarchy:
Feature - High-level functionality
File - Where code lives
Function - What code does
Variable - Data that functions use
Code - Actual implementation
Implementation Logic - Step-by-step flow

Everything down to the entities and dtheir elements and relationships to others, and all the logic in between. So every variable name is defined with its purpose. Once that is all defined, tests can be developed to validate the requirements of each bit of code file and feature. Which is great to go about creating projects from a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. 

Following that, I wanted to come up with a plan for how I will break up the work between AI agents. And that plan is to pre plan the prompts for each AI agent. I first heard about this concept on YouTube - creating Project Requirements Prompts (PRP) to break down PRDs into AI agent tasks. Where they would create a PRD and then break it down into prompts for each AI agent. The difference between that and what I'm calling a Pre-Development Planning Workflow (PDPW). A plan that does the job of a PRD, and a PRP, but goes deeper than anything else I've seen so far. 

I did this with Claude Sonnet 4 with thinking and Canvas with awesome results. 

The full workflow I developed takes potentially hours upfront but saves weeks of debugging and rework. Here's exactly how to do it..

## Overview

This comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) workflow template helps product managers, developers, and entrepreneurs create implementation-ready specifications that AI coding tools can execute reliably. Instead of spending weeks iterating on ambiguous requirements, this systematic approach produces detailed technical specifications that eliminate guesswork for both human developers and AI assistants.

**Perfect for:** Product managers working with AI tools, solo developers, startup founders, and technical teams looking to streamline their product development process.

**Key Benefits:**
- Reduces AI coding errors through precise specifications
- Eliminates ambiguity in product requirements
- Provides complete tech stack guidance with open-source recommendations
- Includes comprehensive testing strategy and implementation checklists
- Creates reusable AI context blocks for consistent development

## The Complete 9-Phase Workflow

### **Phase 1: Initial Brain Dump & Clarification**

Transform scattered ideas into focused product definitions through structured questioning and analysis.

#### **Step 1.1: Brain Dump Prompt**
```
You are an expert Product Manager assistant and requirements analyst. Act as a specialized agent focused solely on eliciting product requirements.

I have [X] ideas, my goal? Pick the one that will be quick and draw the most interest.
[LIST YOUR IDEAS HERE]

Following these rules:
1. Analyze my brain dump step-by-step
2. Guide me by asking specific, targeted questions (1-3 at a time)
3. Cross-reference all information for completeness
4. State assumptions explicitly and ask for validation
5. Regularly verify our direction before shifting focus

Ask me the most important 1-3 clarifying questions based on your analysis.
```

#### **Step 1.2: Follow-up Clarification**
```
[Answer their questions]

Continue asking clarifying questions until we have:
- Clear product definition
- Target user identified  
- Technical approach decided
- Scope boundaries established
```

### **Phase 2: Research & Technical Foundation**

Leverage open-source tools and proven tech stacks to minimize custom development work.

#### **Step 2.1: Open Source Research Prompt**
```
Great! Now I want to find open source tools and popular tech stacks for [PROJECT TYPE]. 

Search for:
1. Most popular frameworks for [SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY AREA]
2. Open source libraries that would help with [KEY FUNCTIONALITY]
3. Proven tools I can use instead of building from scratch

I want to go with whatever will work that is the most popular option. If we don't have to build everything from scratch I would prefer to use anything open source that would work.

Provide:
- Specific tool recommendations with pros/cons
- How exactly they help us and what problems they solve
- What we DON'T have to build because of these tools
```

#### **Step 2.2: Tech Stack Decision Prompt**
```
Based on your research, help me finalize the tech stack. I want to understand:

For each recommended tool:
- What specific purpose will it serve in our project?
- What problems does it solve for us?
- How does it integrate with other tools?
- What are the alternatives and why is this the best choice?

Update the PRD document with the chosen tech stack and integration points.
```

### **Phase 3: Data Architecture & Entity Modeling**

Create comprehensive data models that eliminate ambiguity for AI development tools.

#### **Step 3.1: Data Modeling Prompt**
```
Now let's establish the data foundation using proper data modeling methodology.

Follow this structure:
1. **Conceptual Data Modeling** - Plain English definitions of entities & relationships
2. **Logical Data Modeling** - Detailed entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints (technology independent)  
3. **Physical Data Modeling** - Explicit implementation (database schema, storage API calls, etc.)

For each entity, define:
- Entity purpose in plain English
- All attributes with data types and constraints
- Relationships with other entities
- Dependencies and validation rules

I want every single variable defined with its purpose so AI tools know exactly what each piece of data represents.
```

#### **Step 3.2: Entity Definition Refinement**
```
For the logical data modeling section, I want every single variable with a definition like:

**Entity: [EntityName]** - [plain english purpose/definition]
**Element 1.** variableName (DataType, Constraints) - [plain english purpose/definition]
**Element 2.** nextVariable (DataType, Constraints) - [plain english purpose/definition]

This eliminates any ambiguity for AI coding tools.
```

### **Phase 4: Feature Implementation Planning**

Break down features into AI-executable modules with complete specifications.

#### **Step 4.1: Feature Breakdown Prompt**
```
Now break down the features into implementation-ready modules. I want:

1. **Module-level breakdown** - Major feature groups
2. **Feature-level breakdown** - Specific functionality within modules  
3. **Line-by-line breakdown** - Individual functions and logic
4. **Variable-level breakdown** - Every variable, type, and purpose

For each feature:
- Purpose and description
- Required files and their locations
- All functions with input/output specifications
- All variables with types and purposes
- Implementation logic and error handling

I want this detailed enough that I can feed it directly to AI coding tools without ambiguity.
```

#### **Step 4.2: Implementation Detail Prompt**
```
For the features section, I want implementation-ready TypeScript code examples that show:

- Complete interfaces and type definitions
- Function signatures with full logic
- Error handling patterns  
- Integration points between modules
- Chrome extension specific patterns [OR your platform]

These should be copy-paste ready for AI coding tools - not pseudocode, but actual implementation guides.
```

### **Phase 5: Testing Strategy**

Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) with comprehensive testing infrastructure.

#### **Step 5.1: Test Infrastructure Prompt**
```
Add comprehensive testing infrastructure to the project structure. I want:

1. **Test file locations** - Where tests go in the file tree
2. **Test types** - Unit, integration, E2E test structure
3. **Test configuration** - Jest, Playwright, etc. setup
4. **Test implementation checklist** - What tests to write for each feature

This should enable Test-Driven Development where I write tests first based on requirements, then use tests to verify AI-generated implementations work correctly.
```

#### **Step 5.2: Test Requirements Prompt**
```
For each feature in the implementation checklist, add specific test requirements that verify:

- All variables are properly implemented
- All functions work as specified  
- Integration points function correctly
- Error handling works as expected
- [PLATFORM-SPECIFIC] requirements are met

Include examples of actual test code that validates the requirements.
```

### **Phase 6: AI Agent Context Creation**

Optimize AI interactions with reusable context blocks for consistent development.

#### **Step 6.1: Context Block Prompt**
```
Create an AI Agent Context Block that gives AI tools just enough context to make good decisions without burning tokens. Include:

- Project overview and user flow
- Tech stack and architecture pattern  
- Core entities and relationships
- Key file structure and patterns
- Critical constraints and conventions
- Integration points and patterns

This should be ~300-400 tokens, reusable for every prompt, and contain everything an AI needs to understand the project architecture.
```

### **Phase 7: Implementation Checklist Creation**

Generate project management ready checklists with clear priorities and dependencies.

#### **Step 7.1: Comprehensive Checklist Prompt**
```
Create an exhaustive implementation checklist with:

1. **Entity Implementation Checklist** - Track every variable across all features
2. **File Structure Setup** - Complete project tree with all files
3. **Feature Implementation Checklist** - Step-by-step tasks grouped by feature
4. **Testing Implementation** - Test creation and validation tasks

Format as checkboxes with:
- Clear file paths and purposes
- Implementation references linking back to detailed code samples  
- Priority order for logical development sequence
- Cross-references between entities and features

This should be copy-paste ready for project management tools like Trello.
```

#### **Step 7.2: Reference Integration Prompt**
```
Connect the implementation checklist to the detailed code samples by adding "Implementation Reference" links to each task that point back to the relevant code examples in the Features section.

Add instructions on how to use these references with AI coding tools:
1. Find task in checklist
2. Click implementation reference link  
3. Copy relevant code sample
4. Feed to AI with "Implement this based on this specification"
5. Run tests to verify implementation
```

### **Phase 8: Quality Assurance & Finalization**

Ensure completeness and AI-readiness through systematic gap analysis.

#### **Step 8.1: Gap Analysis Prompt**
```
Review the entire PRD for any placeholders, pseudocodes, or unexplained elements that might catch me by surprise during implementation. Flag:

- Missing configuration details
- Incomplete setup instructions  
- Undefined integration patterns
- Ambiguous requirements
- Missing dependencies or prerequisites

Ensure everything needed for implementation is clearly defined.
```

#### **Step 8.2: AI Sufficiency Check Prompt**
```
Verify that if I combine:
1. The AI Agent Context Block
2. Any individual module from the implementation checklist  
3. The referenced code samples

An AI agent would have sufficient information to implement that module correctly. Identify any gaps where additional context would be needed.
```

### **Phase 9: Template Creation**

Create self-contained implementation modules for independent development.

#### **Step 9.1: Self-Contained Module Prompts**
```
[Optional] Create self-contained module implementation prompts that include:
- Context block
- Complete entity definitions for that module
- Full code samples and patterns
- Specific test requirements  
- Success criteria

This ensures each module can be implemented independently without reference to other documents.
```
