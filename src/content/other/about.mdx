Hello! I’m Christopher Kvamme (Stack-Junkie)
I'm a wannabe developer based in Vancouver, Washington.

In June 2023 I earned my B.S. in Engineering Technology – Electronics 
from DeVry University. I originally started in computer engineering, 
but swapped majors for my hands-on electronics work—and never looked back.

Since the launch of ChatGPT, I’ve been experimenting with AI-assisted 
development—sketching out a couple dozen app ideas, scrapping the ones 
that stalled, and building a handful of buggy MVPs along the way. If 
you’re curious about AI tooling, electronics, or just wantto commiserate 
over scrapped projects, you’re in the right place. Welcome to my journey!
